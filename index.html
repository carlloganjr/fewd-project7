        internet, let's see how you might </span><span class="spanList">connect
        your personal devices to the internet inside your house.  </span>
        <span class="spanList">Well there are many ways to connect to the internet,
        and </span><span class="spanList">most often people connect wirelessly.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span class="spanList">Let's look at an example of how you can connect
